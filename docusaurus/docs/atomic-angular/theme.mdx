title: Theme

## Overview
A theme is a collection of variables utilized in the DOM to apply consistent colors, spacing, and typography based on the specified collection. In this context, the theme exclusively provides color variables.

For example, a "red" theme would define a range of red shades that vary according to the significance of the content. Additionally, it would include other shades to reflect different contexts, such as secondary, danger, or muted tones.

We manage both light and dark color for the same theme.

### Scope

A scope defines which theme to apply to an identifier, including the associated CSS variables and the mode to be used.

## ThemeStore

### Description

The `ThemeStore` fetches a collection of themes from a static files, saves scopes content, handles scopes updates.

### API

| Function                                                                | Description                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `loadDefaultTheme(scope: string, darkMode?: boolean)`                   | Load theme `Default` theme for given `scope`. |
| `setCurrentTheme(scope: string, themeName: string, darkMode?: boolean)` | Update given `scope` to use `themeName`.      |
| `setDarkMode(scope: string, darkMode: boolean)`                         | Update given `scope` to `darkMode`.           |



## Theme providers

### withThemes

`withThemes()` function allow you to push your own theme into the theme array and make it available to use.

```ts
const THEMES = [{...}];

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig)
  .then((app) => withThemes(app, THEMES))
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

Exporting themes from a dedicated file is recommended, as themes can be pretty heavy.

### withThemeBodyHook

`withThemeBodyHook` function allow you to create a special scope, declared with `APPLICATION_THEME_SCOPE = 'application'`, attached to the `<body>` tag using `window.document.body` reference. It will call `themeStore.loadDefaultTheme()` to set everything up at application's bootstrap.

If you want to use a theme over your entire application this is your way to go.

```ts
const THEMES = [{...}];

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig)
  .then((app) => withThemes(app, THEMES))
  .then(withThemeBodyHook)
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));
```



## ThemeProviderDirective

### Description

The `ThemeProviderDirective` takes in argument a scope name. It looks for the associated theme name from the `ThemeStore` and apply the CSS variable to on DOM element the directive is attached to. That means every child element will inherit from the theme, but also that you can nest theme.
