title: Filters
---

A list of default Filters has been defined and can be configured in different ways.

* by overriding the Token: **AGGREGATIONS_NAMES**
* by overriding the `getAuthorizedFilters` function of the store: **AppStore** (see Stores).
* or simply by creating your own component.
  ðŸ‘‰ _core/components/filters/filters-list.component.ts_

Here, we will see how to customize the list using the Token: **AGGREGATIONS_NAMES**
## Overriding AGGREGATIONS_NAMES

The list of predefined filters is accessible via the constant:
* **AGGREGATIONS_NAMES_PRESET_DEFAULT**

So, if you want to simply add new filters, you just need to add a new entry in the list of _providers_ in the _app.config.ts_ file:

```ts title="app.config.ts"
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
Â  providers: [
	{ provide: AGGREGATIONS_NAMES, useValue: [...AGGREGATIONS_NAMES_PRESET_DEFAULT, "Money"] }
  ]
}
```
line 3, we add the aggregation named "Money" to the default filters list.

:::tip
You can simply put your own list of aggregations here, in the form of a string array.
```ts
{ provide: AGGREGATIONS_NAMES, useValue: ["Treepath","Person","Geo","Money"] }
```

## Components breakdown
### Filters List
<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/overview/20240701084723.png')} alt="Filters list"/>
This component is responsible for displaying the authorized filters (see override **AGGREGATIONS_NAMES**) as a horizontal list.

```html
<FiltersList /> or <filters-list />
```

The number of visible items by default is 5, but it can be customized using the Token **FILTERS_BREAKPOINT** in the file ðŸ‘‰ _app.config.ts_.
```ts title="app.config.ts"
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
Â  providers: [
	{ provide: FILTERS_BREAKPOINT, useValue: 6 }
  ]
}
```

Each filter is represented by a button. There are 3 types of buttons:
* date
* generic (applies to all filters that are not _dates_)
* "more filters"
All these buttons are located in the folder ðŸ‘‰ _filters/buttons_

### Filter Button
These buttons are responsible for displaying the name of the aggregation they are associated with, as well as the first selected filter and a counter indicating how many other filters have also been applied for this aggregation.

```html
<FilterButton column="" /> or <filter-button column="" />
```

| Input  | Type   | Description                                      |
| ------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| column | string | Column identifier of the aggregation to display |

### Aggregation
This component is responsible for displaying the content of an aggregation, selecting items, and applying filters.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/overview/20240701084821.png')} alt="Aggregation"/>

```html
<Aggregation name="" [searchable]="false" />
or
<aggregation name="" [searchable]="false" />
```

| Input      | Type               | Description                                                                                |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| name       | string \| null     | Identifier of the aggregation                                                               |
| kind       | "column" \| "name" | Type of the identifier. By default, the type is "name".                                      |
| headless   | boolean            | Indicates if the component header should be hidden. By default, the value is "false".       |
| searchable | boolean            | Indicates if the aggregation can be searched. By default, the value is "true". |

Each row is represented by the component _aggregation-row.component.ts_

### Aggregation Row
```html
<AggregationRow node="" (onSelect)="" (onOpen)="" />
or
<aggregation-row (onSelect)="" (onOpen)="" />
```

| Input      | Type                | Description                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| node       | AggregationListItem | Represents an item in the aggregation list. |

| Output     | Type                | Description                                                                                    |

| onOpen()   | AggregationListItem | Triggered when a node is opened. Only used by tree-type aggregations. |

### Date
This component can be used to display date-type aggregations.
This component inherits from the **Aggregation** component and adds its own specifics.
<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/overview/20241122144700.png')} alt="Date"/>

```html
<DateFilter /> or <date-filter />
