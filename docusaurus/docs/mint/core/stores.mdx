# Overview
Angular applications generally rely on services for managing the state of components or the application.

With "Mint", we have chosen to use **"signal stores"**.

Overall, they behave the same as a standard Angular service, except here, the properties are **"signals"** (features provided by Angular 18).

## Schemas

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/stores/20241120140201.png')} alt="Stores schema"/>
All stores are globally accessible by the application. However, stores related to a search (query) can also be specifically attached to a component.

:::note
A detailed description of the stores is available in the documentation related to the [**atomic-library**](../../atomic/intro).

## Customize a store
All stores can be extended so that you can add your own features to them.
The store most likely to be modified is the **user-settings store**.

By default, this store contains all the useful functions to modify the **user-settings**.
But if you want to add your own features, here's how to do it:

### Step 1
Create a file **user-settings.store.ts** in the **app/stores** folder. Create the folder if it does not exist.

### Step 2
Extend the original **user-settings** store.

:::note
This is not truly inheritance in the "class" sense, but rather importing functionalities (functions).
:::

```ts title="app/stores/my-user-settings.store.ts"
import {
	withBookmarkFeatures,
	withRecentSearchFeatures,
	withSavedSearchFeatures,
	withUserSettingsFeatures
} from '@sinequa/atomic-angular';

export const MyUserSettingsStore = signalStore(
	{ provideId: 'root' },
	withState({}),
	withUserSettingsFeatures(),
	withBookmarkFeatures(),
	withRecentSearchFeatures(),
	withSavedSearchFeatures(),
	withMetods((store) => {
		/* put your code here */
	})
)
```
line 9 indicates that this store will be accessible throughout the entire application.
lines 2 to 5, import the existing _"features"_ from the original store. Feel free to import the features you want.
line 10, determine the initial state of your "store".

### Step 3
Inform the application to use your store instead of the original store when necessary.
This operation is performed in the **app.config.ts** file in the "providers" section.

```ts title="app.config.ts"
import { UserSettingsStore } from "@sinequa/atomic-angular";
import { MyUserSettingsStore } from "@/app/stores/my-user-settings.store"

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
	  { provide: UserSettingsStore, useExisting: MyUserSettingsStore }
  ]
```

line 6, inform the application that when a component requests access to the original **UserSettingsStore**, it should be redirected to the new store: **MyUserSettingsStore**.

:::warning
Be careful when using automatic imports by your IDE when you use the **user-settings** store to ensure that it is your store being imported.

Normally, this should not have much impact thanks to the provider override done above.
