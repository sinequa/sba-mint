title: Pages
---

This is where the application pages are located as described in the routes file: _app.routes.ts_.

There are currently 2 main pages:
- **Home**, the home page
- **Search**, the search page. It is further divided into several other pages by existing tabs.

## Structure du dossier _Pages_

``` 
 pages
  +-- home/
  |   +-- home.component
  |
  +-- search/
  |   +-- all/
  |   |   +-- search-all.component
  |   |
  |   +-- search.component
  |
  +-- app.component
```


| Page        | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| home/       | This is the landing page. It displays the most recently viewed documents, recent searches, and bookmarks.                              |
| search/     | This folder contains the **search** component which represents the layout of the page. This component is intended to be very simple.   |
| search/all/ | This folder contains the component(s) that will be used to display search results.                                                     |

:::note
It is possible to use different components for each tab or for each type of returned documents. For this, you need to look at the file _app/registry/document-type-registry.ts_.

For simplicity reasons, in "Mint" we use only one component to display a result regardless of the tab or its type (html, pdf, slide...)
